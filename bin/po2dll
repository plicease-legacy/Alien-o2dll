=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Note>: The idea was that I (or someone else) might end up using this somewhere else.
I didn't realize that libbz2 was special, and that there are better ways of doing
this.  Please consider using L<Alien::MSYS> or C<libtool> or something like that.

For details, please see L<Alien::o2dll>.
